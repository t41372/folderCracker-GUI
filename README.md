# folderCracker-GUI
 
This app helps you delete all the folders under a directory and get all the files out.

For example, you might have a folder with tons of sub folders. Some of the sub folders are empty, some others are not, but now you want to get all the files out and get rid of those messy folders. This app helps you do that!
