This app helps you delete all the subfolders under a directory and get all the files out.

For example, you might have a folder with tons of subfolders. Some of the subfolders are empty, some others are not, but now you want to get all the files out and get rid of those messy folders. This app will delete all the subfolders and move all of the files into a new folder called "result"
